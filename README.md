## Welcome to CoinciERAvie
An interesting project dreamed up by myself (Andrew Chingos) and Luca Schmidt to look at coincident rates of climate extremes in ERA5 data (and possibly model data)

The idea was born out of conversations from the Connecting Climate Expertise in Scotland meeting in December of 2025 and from a proposed hackathon relating to extreme temperatures from the st Andrews CDL (climate dynamics lab) lead by Mike Byrne.
